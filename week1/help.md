## help()
* You can open the API documentation for Python directly in the REPL. There is a built in `help()` command where you can enter in a method for documentation. For example, `help(ai.find)` returns:

```python
Help on built-in function find:

find(...)
    S.find(sub [,start [,end]]) -> int

    Return the lowest index in S where substring sub is found,
    such that sub is contained within S[start:end].  Optional
    arguments start and end are interpreted as in slice notation.

    Return -1 on failure.
```

Note this is open in a terminal text editor. You may need to close the documentation by pressing `:` + `q` or `ctrl` + `x`.
